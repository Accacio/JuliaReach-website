## Prize announcement

The [ARCH 2020 Best Result Award](https://cps-vo.org/node/69589) goes to Luis Benet, Marcelo Forets, Daniel Freire, David P. Sanders, and Christian Schilling (in alphabetical order) for their verification tool JuliaReach. The award comes with a 500 Euro prize. Congratulations!

## Resolution

We will give the prize to Sebastian (`@sebastianguadalupe`), a Uruguayan
undergraduate student who collabored with us on the Julia Seasons of Contributions 2020 edition.

Sebastian will work on zonotope-based methods applied to hybrid systems.
He will be writing a tool for reachability analysis of neural-network controlled systems
to leverage on the JuliaReach ecosystem and [sisl/NeuralVerification.jl](https://github.com/sisl/NeuralVerification.jl)
from the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory library.
